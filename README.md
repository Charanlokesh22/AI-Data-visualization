# Project: Advanced Data Visualizations for Insights

## Overview
This project generates advanced data visualizations to provide insights into user performance across various topics, difficulty levels, and historical trends. The visualizations include bubble charts, radar charts, stacked bar charts, and line charts, designed to help users analyze their strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

The data used in this project is based on performance scores across different subjects and difficulty levels, and it includes predictions and recommendations based on the user's current and historical performance.

## Approach
The project takes in performance data related to different subjects and difficulty levels, such as Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Using this data, we generate the following visualizations:

1. **Bubble Chart**: Represents the relationship between topic performance and difficulty levels. The bubble size is based on the performance score, providing a visual sense of how performance varies by topic and difficulty.
2. **Stacked Bar Chart**: Shows the breakdown of performance across topics and difficulty levels, providing a clear view of how the user is performing in each category.
3. **Radar Chart**: Compares the performance across topics and difficulty levels in a circular format, offering a holistic view of strengths and weaknesses.
4. **Line Chart**: Displays historical performance trends over time, helping the user track improvement or decline across quizzes.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
Use the `git clone` command to clone the project repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory
Use the `cd` command to move into the project folder where the repository was cloned.

```bash
cd <project_directory>
```

### 3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
Create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

- For Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

- For macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install the dependencies
Once the virtual environment is set up and activated, install the required dependencies for the project using `pip`:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas plotly
```

Alternatively, if you have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install all dependencies at once:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Project
After installing the dependencies, you can run the Python script that generates the visualizations:

```bash
python advanced_visualizations.py
```

This will run the script and display the visualizations.

## Visualizations

### 1. Bubble Chart: Topic Performance vs Difficulty Levels
The bubble chart visualizes how performance in different topics correlates with performance in various difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). The size of each bubble reflects the performance score for each topic.

### 2. Stacked Bar Chart: Performance Breakdown
The stacked bar chart breaks down the user's performance by topic and difficulty levels. It allows for an easy comparison of how much time and effort should be spent on each category.

### 3. Radar Chart: Comparing Performance Across Topics and Difficulty Levels
The radar chart offers a way to compare how well the user is performing across different topics and difficulty levels. It provides a holistic view in a circular format, making it easier to spot areas that need improvement.

### 4. Line Chart: Historical Performance Trend
The line chart plots the user's performance over time, showing how their performance has changed across different quizzes. This helps track improvement or identify stagnation.

## Example Input Data

```python
insights = {
    'current': {
        'overall_score': 70.0,
        'topic_performance': {'Physics': 50.0, 'Chemistry': 100.0, 'Biology': 66.67},
        'difficulty_performance': {'Easy': 0.73, 'Medium': 0.85, 'Hard': 0.67},
        'time_management': {'avg_time': 45.5, 'max_time': 65, 'min_time': 30}
    },
    'historical': {
        'trend': [90.0, 70.0, 40.0, 90.0, 90.0],
        'difficulty_performance': {'Easy': 0.73, 'Medium': 0.85, 'Hard': 0.67}
    }
}

recommendations = [
    "Focus on improving Physics. Work on key topics like Mechanics and Optics.",
    "Increase practice in Biology, specifically Genetics and Plant Biology.",
    "Work on harder difficulty questions to improve accuracy in challenging problems.",
    "Practice time management through time-bound mock tests to improve speed."
]
```
